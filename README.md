Explanation of the Javascript code:


target: the CSS selector that corresponds to the HTML element that will contain the plot. Look at the HTML code (<div id="myFunction"></div>), the id value corresponds to target: "#myFunction" in the object.

data: this is where we indicate the value of the function(s) to be plotted. We talk about this in greater detail below.coordplane
grid: this can be true or false (we call these "boolean values") and indicates whether or not we want a grid to be drawn in the background.

xAxis: the value specifies the domain (range) for the x values...

yAxis: the value specifies the domain (range) for the y values...
